        h3 User stories:
        blockquote

        ul
            li  I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string
                        contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
            li  If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
            li  If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

        h3 Example usage:
        blockquote

            p https://#{curPath}December%2015,%202015
            p https://#{curPath}1450137600

        h3 Example output:
            p.
                {
                  "unix": 1450137600,
                  "natural": "December 15, 2015"
                }
